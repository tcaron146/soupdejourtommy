These tacos were absolutely mad they were so fire I can't even explain it hands down best shrimp tacos in the game. The fries were also perfectly cooked and they tasted delicious. 100% recommend if you drive by stop by for so crazy seafood it's absolutely bangin in there."

The nachos are pretty solid but I've definitely had better. The burrito was pretty crazy won't lie I might have it again sometime idk.

I pull up tot he drive thru and i ask for a 20 piece nugget meal right and they say they're out of 20 piece meals like what how are you out but you still have 4 piece meals out 5 of those together and you have 20 come on. So I ask for a double quarter pounder instead they're out of those too so She gives me a side of fries and a sprite that didn't taste like sprite at all and I look in the bottom of the bag and what was there a 20 piece nugget but these were hands down the worst nuggets I've ever eaten I didn't think they could actually be bad but they made them bad. Highly recommend not going to this mcdonalds it was a huge let down.1/10"

His name was Charlie and I have to tell you I hope his parents know what a great kid he is because wow he was amazing I couldn't believe the service he provided it was incredible. Also the nachos were amazing and the wings were some of the best I've ever had. The burger could be better but hey nothing is perfect. What I will say is that I would go here again tomorrow to see Charlie and I live in Boston. Wonderful place highly recommend, also ask for Charlie as a waiter because everyone should have this experience."

The pork was amazing it was perfectly cooked juicy Smokey and tender. The chicken wings were bomb as well they were Smokey and delicious. I didn't get to see Pitmaster Paul \"Doug\" but I felt like he was right there with me while I was eating my sandwich. Awesome place the blueberry soda is amazing as well highly recommend."

I got the steamers and the lobster roll and both were extravagant. The lobster was so god damn fresh I could feel it all the way through my body from head to toe. The chips were pretty solid as well. The clams and butter sauce were epic as well. The service was everything but bad meaning it was epic service. All around great place and great food would definitely recommend!"

We started off with some fried lobster bites and they were something that I've never had before but boy were they delicious. Then I moved onto the fish and chips which to be clear was one of the bigger portions I've gotten when ordering this meal. The fish was pretty solid maybe a little dry in some areas but it was cooked pretty well overall. The lobster roll was pretty solid as well, it was a little sweet but the lettuce and roll didn't take away from the lobster which is just how it should be. Great place overall definitely give it a try."

The lobster however was a small portion which was the only downside. The fried were exquisite and the sprite was sensational. Overall this place was pretty solid I give it a 4 just because the portions were a little small but other than that very good."

The breakfast is amazing everytime, the pancakes, eggs, bacon, toast, french toast, and hash, and home fries are amazing. That's all they are amazing try them for yourself. Now if you come in here for a little lunch action a burger is a great way to go. It's a flavorful blend of cheese a nicely toasted bun and a wonderfully sized little diner patty. You cannot go wrong with this. Also a little shake wouldn't be bad with this meal either. The veal cutlet is delicious as well I've only tried it once but I loved it and my friends get it everytime we stop in for lunch. Now the pie is amazing the coconut pie the banana pie and every other pie there are outstanding. I've been coming here for years and I've never had anything like it. Easy 5 star 10/10 favorite place to eat some good non expensive food."

The chicken was perfectly cooked and the ratio of ingredients was perfect. The fries were pretty average but it's not why I went. The biscuit was delicious, moist and buttery. The collard greens were awesome I ate them with the top of the container because right as I went to get a fork lightning struck and the power went off on the whole street and the whole world collapsed around me. Overall it was an easy 10/10, I left and about an hour later I was craving another sandwich."

Hear me out, I've been eating frozen peas and frozen turkey for the past 8 days the food is sub par here at school. I'll have you know I haven't seen civilization in over a week . This sub was the second coming of Jesus. So compliments to the chef I love you. Get this guy a raise at least. I'm coming back. I didn't even mention the chipotle sauce on the side but that's essential. I had to sit down and take a deep breathe after this I'll be honest. Oh ya and the portions are absolutely out of hand, massive portions a large is nearly two subs, just what I needed. How could I forget the delivery was literally like 15 minutes absolutely out of hand this place. If it's not the pickle barrel way it's the wrong way!! WOOOOHOOOOO, I'm electric right now. Thank you to pickle barrel for the amazing experience this sandwich made me a better person."

Cabbage chipotle sauce bangin cheese and beef was the MOVE. It melts together in your mouth and life starts to make sense. You start connecting the dots and before you know it you've become a different person, the nachos are gone and you want to go back for more, but the night must go on. 10/10 on these nachos and hear me out I don't give a lot of tens.

    "Comment": "Listen to me right now, if you had a poncho and lefty in one hand and a western burger in the other you would be more dangerous than mike Tyson in the summer of 1989. When you go here you only need one meal for the whole day I'll tell you that right now. The poncho and lefty is something out of the Bible, it has many layers each with a different meaning, one with love, one with darkness, and one that makes you want to go for a run, the beans chorizo and tortilla with the potato and the one hot pepper on the side to kick things up a notch when you need it create a wonderful combination of flavors and makes an outstanding experience. The burger was probably one the juiciest burgers I've ever tried and the Texas toast elevated it to a whole different level. That's it I could taste the beef in the burger which is amazing because normally you just taste cheese and bacon and weird sauce and toppings when you bite into a burger but I tasted the beef and it blended with the Texas toast in the most sexual way it was amazing. Listen to me when I tell you if walk out of this place with a poncho and lefty and a western burger you will become a different person after you finish that meal. 10/10"

I personally got the Loretta burgie cooked medium, nothing new here, fries were superb thin and crispy just how I like them. Burger was great juicy and all but a tiny bit fry around the edges, I'm gonna be a stickler for $17. Jam and bun were great loved what it brought to the table, pun intended. I also tried the burrata ravioli tings, they were pretty damn good loved the sauce very light but bold and when it hit my tongue it would run across my tongue like a cool summer haze. Little too much cheese on the pasta I feel like it should be a thing where they come over and you tell them when, the cheese got super stuck together but it didn't take away from the flavor which is the important part. Love it here will be back. 8.1/10"

I ate it in under two minutes, no bev, and it was exquisite. There was nothing even remotely wrong with that jr beef. Perfect ratio of beef mayo sauce and that slice of American on the bottom bun just how I like it, no soggy bottom bun, crisp as a winters breeze. I will be back but I might throw some rings in the order next time. My favorite beef now. 8.9/10. No picture today my mouth was watering, I kept taking short whiffs of the bag on the way home and I almost had to pull over and take a deep breathe, I've never showed those types of smelt ions for a jr beef before, brought out a side of me I didn't know was there. Excellent job zenos, keep it up."

I love James river sauce stupid fire and all but let me tell you something, I like a little kick with my sauces and athas brought that to the table. Cheese and Mayo were near perfect. I said this yesterday but this beef made me feel a way I haven't felt in years, kind of got the feeling I got when I kissed a girl for the first time.

I got the honky think chicken and the chicken itself was crispy and tasteful, however the slaw is random as hell and It didn't come with any of the sauce that I ordered, could've been a game changer for me. Soggy bun like soggy soggy, it was foul maybe if it was toasted it would be better or if it was bread that would be cool. But it was just the top of two sesame buns idk if that's a thing but it was not it. I would've put the chicken in the buns if they weren't so soggy and the slaw was just odd, not my thing. On a good note the Sid of max was good nice and baked on top and creamy in the middle couldn't really go wrong there."

The bun was still crispy and crunchy when I ate it after 15 minutes of bag sitting, impeccable stat if you ask me. Ratio was 100% the best I've seen to this day I thought it was perfect, every bite brought me new ideas but I felt the same emotions each time I took a gobble. I knocked it down in about one minute, no sweat. Beef was pink throughout no grey at all, couldn't ask for much more there. Cheese just how I like it. Pretty close to perfect for sitting in the bag for 15 minutes is impressive. 9.3/10. I'll be back before you know it. Try it out for yourself."
